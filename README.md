Experiments with microcontrollers (Arduino / ATTiny devices) that aren't large enough to deserve their own repository

## Sensor
Charts CO2 readings from an Amphenol CO2 sensor to a small OLED display.

This sensor (T6703) was pulled out of an abandonware Awair 2nd generation air quality monitor. Both the sensor and display (SSD1306) are directly hooked up via I2C, greatly simplifying wiring.
